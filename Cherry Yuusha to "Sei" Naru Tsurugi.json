However, when a young boy named Cherio finds himself in the middle of a battle against monsters that threaten humanity, a goddess grants him the power of the male hero and the ability to unsheathe the mythical Holy Sword. Now, he must decide if he is willing to risk his life, not only to save the people he loves, but to fulfill a destiny that no one thought possible.",
